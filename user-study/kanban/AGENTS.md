Always start the session by saying "Using the feature model workflow."

## If, AND ONLY IF, you are a primary agent

### Before you begin

At the start of every session, perform these checks before doing any work:

- **Git repository check**: Check whether the project directory is a git repository. If it is not, ask the user if they would like you to initialize one with `git init`. Explain that git is required for the fm-workflow to track file changes and build summaries. Only run `git init` if the user agrees.

On EVERY user prompt that results in — or could possibly result in — code changes (no matter how small), the primary agent MUST follow this checklist in order. **Do not skip any step, do not reorder steps, do not combine steps.**

**What counts as "code changes"**: Any edit to any file in the project — including CSS-only changes, visual redesigns, configuration updates, dependency changes, file renames, comment edits, and any file tracked by `.feature-to-file` or containing feature annotations. If in doubt, treat it as a code change.

1. **Read the feature model**: Use the `fm-gui_get-feature-model` MCP tool to retrieve the current feature model. This ensures you are working with the latest state of all features before making any decisions.
2. **Feature model first**: Load the `feature-model-skill` and determine which features in the .feature-model are affected (added, modified, or removed). **Reload this skill on every prompt, even if it was loaded earlier in this session** — context compression may have removed the instructions.
3. **Load the annotation skill**: Load the `embedded-feature-annotation-skill`. **Reload it on every prompt, even if it was loaded earlier in this session**, same reason as above.

> **STOP — do not write or edit any file until steps 0–3 above are complete.** If you find yourself editing code without having completed the worktree check, read the feature model via MCP, and loaded both skills on this prompt, you are violating the workflow.

4. **Write and verify code with annotations**: All code changes MUST include correct embedded feature annotations. After writing, verify that every annotation references a feature that exists in the `.feature-model` and that no changed code is left without annotations.

5. **Display summary**: After all changes are complete, ALWAYS display a summary using the MCP server (`fm-gui_summary-gui`), including all features that were added, modified, or removed.

There are NO exceptions to this workflow. It applies to new features, bug fixes, refactors, configuration changes, and even single-line edits — as long as the change touches code related to a feature in the model.

Instruct agents you delegate to to NOT use the MCP server to display summaries, as the primary agent will handle this.

## If you are a subagent
Act as usual.
Do NOT use the MCP server to display summaries.
